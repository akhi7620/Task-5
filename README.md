# Bank Operations Simulation

This project simulates basic bank operations using Java Object-Oriented Programming principles. It includes functionalities for managing bank accounts and performing transactions.

## Project Structure

- `src/Main.java`: Entry point of the application that initializes the bank system and handles user interactions.
- `src/Account.java`: Represents a bank account with properties such as account number, account holder, and balance. It includes methods for depositing, withdrawing, and checking the balance.
- `src/Transaction.java`: Represents a bank transaction with properties like transaction ID, amount, and transaction type. It includes a method to retrieve transaction details.
- `src/Bank.java`: Manages multiple accounts and transactions, providing methods to create accounts, perform transactions, and retrieve account details.

1. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository or download the project files.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
4. Compile the Java files using the following command:
   ```
   javac src/*.java
   ```
5. Run the application with the command:
   ```
   java src.Main
   ```

## Usage Example

Once the application is running, you can create accounts, deposit money, withdraw funds, and view transaction details through the user interface provided in the console.
